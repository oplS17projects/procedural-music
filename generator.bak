;;;;;;; GENERATORS

;; make a random note id
;; range: 0-127

;; make a random velocity

;; make a random duration

;; make a random note

;; make a sequence
;; a short sequence of notes that sounds nice
;; this means that they need to:
;;;; - be within a similar octave range
;;;; - be in the same key
;;;; - be quantized to beats

;; possible implementation
;; (make-sequence (make-random-note))
;; 

;;;;;; **will be done in milestone 3+**

;; make note list
;; stitches together notes into a list using recursion
;; 


;; convert note to midi message
;; takes the note id/velocity/duration list
;; makes note on/note off messages with a sleep in between
;; direct communication procedure with interface
